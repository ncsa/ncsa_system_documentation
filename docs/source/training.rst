High-Performance Computing Training
====================================

**There are no specific prerequisite courses or high-performance computing (HPC) experience required before using NCSA resources.** If you are unfamiliar with using HPC and using an HPC cluster, it is highly recommended that you take NCSAâ€™s short tutorial `Using an HPC Cluster for Scientific Applications <https://www.hpc-training.org/xsede/moodle/enrol/index.php?id=71>`_ before continuing.

You can also browse the full list of NCSA's `HPC-Moodle Self-Paced Tutorials <https://www.hpc-training.org/xsede/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11>`_ to learn more about other HPC topics.

Take a look at the `NCSA calendar <https://calendars.illinois.edu/list/7097>`_ for upcoming live (in-person and virtual) training opportunities.
