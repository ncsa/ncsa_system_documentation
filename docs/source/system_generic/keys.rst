Access Methods for NCSA Systems
==================================

To log into any NCSA computer system, you need a **login** account, which consists of a username, a static password, and an attached two-factor authentication method (typically Duo).  Your login account is associated with you as a person, and you should only have one on any one system.  This is different than an **allocation** account, sometimes also called a **charge** account, or a **project** account.  Those accounts are associate with a project or an allocation and keep track of how much resources you are allowed to use.  

For security and legal reasons, you are required to use your 2-factor authentication every time you log into a system at NCSA.  This helps protect our systems and make sure only you are running processes and looking at your data, and helps prevent unauthorized use.  NCSA systems do not, under any circumstances, enable the use of ssh key pairs for logging in for individual user accounts.  

There are exceptions for non-human science gateway login accounts to have ssh keys set up for log, but this does not apply to ordinary user accounts.  If you have a science gateway account, you will have a specific kind of allocation and you'll know this.  To get that set up, submit a ticket to the user support team on the system you're using.
