Login Accounts
------------------

To log into an NCSA computer system, you need a **login** account, for that system, which consists of:

- Username 
- Static password 
- Attached two-factor authentication method (typically Duo)  

Your login account is associated with you as a person, and you should only have one login account per system.  

Your login account is different from an **allocation** account (sometimes also called a **charge** or **project** account). Allocation accounts are associated with a project or an allocation and keep track of the resource amounts you are allowed to use.  

For the `ICRN <https://publish.illinois.edu/ncsa-jupyter/>`_ system, your login account information is your University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, NetID, NetID password, and associated University of Illinois Duo.

SSH Keys
----------

NCSA systems don't allow the use of SSH key pairs for logging into individual user accounts. For security and legal reasons, you are required to use your two-factor authentication *every time* you log into an NCSA system. This helps protect our systems and prevent unauthorized use. 

There are exceptions for non-human, science gateway login accounts, but this does not apply to ordinary user accounts. If you have a science gateway account, you will have a specific kind of allocation. To set up a science gateway login account, submit a support request (:ref:`help`) for the system you are using.
