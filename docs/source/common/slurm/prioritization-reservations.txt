Job Prioritization and Reservations
=====================================

Job Prioritization
-------------------

Slurm prioritizes jobs in the queue based on more than just when the job was submitted. A combination of factors are considered to fairly distribute the compute resources to cluster users. These factors include (but aren't limited to):

- Resources requested for the job: If a smaller job(s) can backfill between larger jobs without delaying higher priority jobs, the smaller job(s) may run before other jobs that were submitted earlier.
- Age of the job in the queue: Higher priority is given to jobs that have been in the queue longer. However, since this is not the only factor considered, newer jobs may run before older jobs.
- Recent account cluster usage: Higher priority is given to jobs on accounts that have *not* had recent cluster usage. Note, this is based on account usage, not just your user usage.
- Portion of total account allocation used: Higher priority is given to jobs on accounts that have used a smaller portion of their total allocation.
- Preemption: Lower priority is given to jobs that are submitted to preempt queues (where available).

If you have concerns about the prioritization of your jobs in the queue, :ref:`submit a support request <help>`.

System Reservations
----------------------------------

Slurm will block your job from starting if there's a reservation scheduled to start before your job would finish. You may be able to shorten the runtime of your job to fit in before the reservation starts.

- If a system maintenance reservation is blocking your job from starting, ``squeue`` will return a message like ``ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance`` in the ``NODELIST(REASON)`` column for your job.

- To see a list of reservations on a system, use ``scontrol show reservations``.
