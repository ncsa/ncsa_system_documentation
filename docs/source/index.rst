.. warning::

   This page is just being built.  Anything linked from this page *is* indeed official NCSA documentation for that system, but this page (the index) is just being created as of August 22, 2022.  When this becomes more stable and points to all NCSA documentation, this notice will be removed.
   
NCSA Computer Systems Documentation
-------------------------------------

- `Nightingale computational system <https://ncsa-nightingale.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ in the Health Enclave (ACHE).  

NCSA System-Generic Documentation
-------------------------------------

Here is a page with `Blue-Waters era legacy code building descriptions <https://ncsa-community-code-reference.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_.  This is posed as a historical reference, but may also be useful in case some of those codes needto be brought up to date.

Below are pages with HPC documentation not specific to any system.  For instance, this section will contain a page with Slurm documentation that's common for all NCSA installs.
