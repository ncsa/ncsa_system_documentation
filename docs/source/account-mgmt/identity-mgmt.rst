Manage Your NCSA Identity
===========================

Use the NCSA Identity and Access Management tool to update your NCSA profile information, reset your NCSA (Kerberos) password, manage your NCSA Duo, and view your NCSA group memberships.

Update Your Profile
--------------------

To update your NCSA profile:

#. Log in to `NCSA Identity - Manage Account <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/manage>`_ with your NCSA username and password.
#. Make your changes. You can update the following fields:

   - Organization
   - Address
   - Phone number
   - Primary email address
   - Secondary email address

     A secondary email address is useful for recovering your NCSA account or resetting your password if you lose access to your primary email account.

#. Click **Save Changes**.

Reset Your Password
---------------------

To reset your NCSA (Kerberos) password:

#. Go to `NCSA Identity - Reset Your Password <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/reset>`_.
#. Enter you NCSA username and click **Submit**.
#. NCSA Identity Services will send a code to the email address listed in your NCSA profile. You will need that code, along with your username, to set a new password.

NCSA Duo Multi-Factor Authentication
---------------------------------------

You are required to use NCSA Duo multi-factor authentication to access NCSA resources. This is separate from your University of Illinois Duo that you have if you are affiliated with the University.
Go to `Duo at NCSA <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/cybersec/Duo+at+NCSA>`_ for information on how to set up and manage your NCSA Duo.

View Your Group Memberships
-----------------------------

To view the NCSA groups that you are a member of, log in to `NCSA Identity - Groups <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/groups>`_ with your NCSA username and password.

To manage (add/remove) members of groups that you are an owner or delegate of, go to :ref:`group-mgmt`.
