Group/Project Member Management
==================================

.. note::
   To manage a project that was awarded via **ACCESS**, go to `ACCESS Allocations <https://allocations.access-ci.org/>`_.

You use the `NCSA Group Management Tool <https://internal.ncsa.illinois.edu/mis/groups/>`_ to add and remove account holders, add delegates, and invite new users to your project. 

NCSA Group Management Tool
-----------------------------

You log in to the `NCSA Group Management Tool <https://internal.ncsa.illinois.edu/mis/groups/>`_ with your NCSA username, Kerberos password, and NCSA Duo MFA.

The first tab you see is the list of groups that you own and can edit.  
If you are the PI of a NCSA project (on Delta, Radiant, Nightingale) you should find a group on that page with the appropriate resource name in the group name.
This is where you can see and edit your project membership.  

Updates to the group membership can take up to **1 hour** to propagate to the system.

Add NCSA Account Holders to a Group/Project
-----------------------------------------------

.. note::
   If the person you want to add doesn't have an NCSA account go to :ref:`invite-new` to learn how to invite them to create one. 

To add a new user, with an existing NCSA account, to your project:

#. Click on the group name you want to add someone to.
#. Enter the name or NCSA account of the person in the field.
#. Click add person.

Invite New Users to a Group/Project
-------------------------------------

Instead of adding new users directly, you can send them an invite to your group/project. This is particularly useful if you want to add several people at the same time. This is also how you add users that don't have existing NCSA accounts.

#. Select the Editable Groups tab.
#. Select the group you want to invite users to.
#. Select the Invitation Info tab under the group heading.
#. View an existing Group Invitation URL or Generate Group Invitation one doesn't exist.

   If you generate a new URL for your project the old URL will no longer work.

#. Share the Group Invitation URL with your users so that they can:

   - Log in with an existing NCSA account or Register as a New User.
   - Provide any information requested for the group you invited them to.

#. Once the user completes the forms at the Group Invitation URL, the group's maintainers will be notified by email to come back to this Group Management page to confirm their request to join your group.

Remove a Member from a Group/Project
-----------------------------------------

To remove a user from a group or project:

#. Click on the group name that you want to remove someone from.
#. Click on the red dot to the right of their email address.

Add a Delegate to a Group/Project
---------------------------------------

Project owners can add delegates to a project to help manage adding and removing account members. To add a delegate:


#. Select the Editable Groups tab.
#. Select the group you want to invite users to.
#. Click the box that says "View/Modify group maintainers".  
#. Enter the name or NCSA account of the delegate.

   Anyone you add in this maintainer set will have full permissions to manage the group membership and invites until they are removed by the **group owner**.
