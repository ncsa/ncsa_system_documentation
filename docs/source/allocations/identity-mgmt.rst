Manage Your NCSA Identity
===========================

.. note::
   To manage a project that was awarded via **ACCESS**, go to `ACCESS Allocations <https://allocations.access-ci.org/>`_.

Manage Your Profile
--------------------

Manage your NCSA account profile at the `NCSA Identity Management <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/manage>`_.

From here, you can update the following:

- Organization
- Address
- Phone number
- Primary email address
- Secondary email address

A secondary email address is useful for recovering your NCSA account or resetting your password if you lose access to your primary email account.

Reset Your Password
---------------------

To reset your NCSA (Kerberos) password, go to `NCSA Identity - Reset Your Password <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/reset>`_

When you submit your NCSA username, NCSA Identity Services will send a code to the email address listed in your NCSA profile. You will need that code, along with your username, to set a new password.

NCSA Duo Multi-Factor Authentication
---------------------------------------

You are required to use NCSA Duo multi-factor authentication to access NCSA resources. This is separate from your University of Illinois Duo that you have if you are affiliated with the University.
Go to `Duo at NCSA <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/cybersec/Duo+at+NCSA>`_ for information on how to set up and manage your NCSA Duo.

View Your Group Memberships
-----------------------------

To view the NCSA groups that you are a member of, go to `NCSA Identity - Groups <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/groups>`_.
