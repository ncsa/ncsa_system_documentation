Getting Help
==============

Explore Solutions
-------------------

System users can often fix problems or help diagnose them on their own. The following are some strategies to try before you submit a support request:

- Search the documentation for relevant keywords; use the search box in the upper left.

- If you're getting an error, perform a web search of the error message (Google, Bing, or others).

- If you're looking for a package, perform a web search for "how do I install <package name>" and try the solutions you find that seem applicable and reasonable.  

When you submit a support request, please let us know what you tried, and what happened if it didn't seem to work.
